## Implementing Agenda-based search and Genetic Algorithm


The goal of this project is to build a route finder using an agenda-based search mechanism. This is done using the London Tube map, which is provided in the form of a CSV file called "tubedata.csv". **Please note that the map may not be up-to-date or complete.**

Three search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) are implemented and compared. Additionally a Heuristic Search algorithm is also implemented to further improve the efficiency of the route finder.

The second section of the project involves implementing a Genetic Algorithm to find a secret phrase.

#### List of project files:

tubedata.csv: contains the data for the London Tube map.


#### List of dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy: for efficient numerical operations
- Pandas: for reading and manipulating CSV files
- Matplotlib: for visualizing the search results and statistics.
